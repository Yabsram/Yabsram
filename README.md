Hi, I'm Yabby! Thanks for stopping by my LinkedIn page! I am a third-year student at Columbia University studying Computer Science and minoring in Applied Math.
I love exploring the world around me, learning new things, picking up new hobbies, and my motto for life is I'll try anything at least once.

Some New Things I'm Doing:
- 🛼 I’m learning how to rollerskate
- 💃 I’m learning how to salsa
- 📖 Currently reading "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"
- 🛠️ Currently working on my fitness website project repo: fitnessProject
- 💬 Ask me about what new recipe I whipped up recently
